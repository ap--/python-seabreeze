# python-seabreeze documentation #

Currently only some features of the module are documented. Look at the
Spectrometer class and read the code in
[spectrometers.py](../seabreeze/spectrometers.py) for more detailed
information. Help improve this documentation by submitting a pull request!


#### class SeabreezeDevice

This class abstracts the device handling. You'll never create your own
instances of a SeabreezeDevice. Calling `list_devices()` returns one instance
for every connected spectrometer. You can use the `SeabreezeDevice.serial` and
`SeabreezeDevice.model` properties to filter through them.

```python
import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
devices = sb.list_devices()
# select all USB2000+ spectrometers
usb2000plus = [d for d in devices if d.model == "USB2000PLUS"]
```

#### class Spectrometer

This is the most important class of the module. You interface any spectrometer
through this class. Instanciate it by providing a SeabreezeDevice:

```python
import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
devices = sb.list_devices()
spec = sb.Spectrometer(devices[0])
```

or by specifying the serial number of your spectrometer:

```python
import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
spec = sb.Spectrometer.from_serial_number("USB2+H02749")
```

The basic features that you might need are:

```python
# serial number
print spec.serial_number
# model
print spec.model
# number of pixels (as returned by seabreeze)
print spec.pixels
# set the integration time in microseconds
spec.integration_time_micros(10000)
# return an array containing all wavelengths
spec.wavelengths()
# return the newest aquired spectrum (with dark count and nonlinearity correction)
spec.intensities(correct_dark_counts=True, correct_nonlinearity=True)
```


#### The documentation still needs work
