Python-seabreeze is the easy way to access your Ocean Optics spectrometers from
python. It wraps the [SeaBreeze](http://oceanoptics.com/product/seabreeze/)
library provided by Ocean Optics to communicate with the spectrometer. If
SeaBreeze is not available it can fallback to a pyUSB based reimplementation.
**This software is not associated with Ocean Optics. Use it at your own risk.**



## tl;dr -- give me the spectrum now!

```
conda install -c poehlmann python-seabreeze
```

**if windows (** force your spectrometer to use a driver from [here](misc/windows-driver-files.zip) **)** <br>
**if linux (** install udev rules from [here](misc/10-oceanoptics.rules) **)**

```python
>>> import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
>>> spec = sb.Spectrometer.from_serial_number()
>>> spec.integration_time_micros(20000)
>>> spec.wavelengths()
array([  340.32581   ,   340.70321186,   341.08058305, ...,  1024.84940994,
        1025.1300678 ,  1025.4106617 ])
>>> spec.intensities()
array([  1.58187931e+01,   2.66704852e+04,   6.80208103e+02, ...,
         6.53090172e+02,   6.35011552e+02,   6.71168793e+02])
```

## Overview

![overview](docs/overview.png)

Starting with version _0.6.0_, python-seabreeze is available as a pre-built
package for Python versions _2.7.x_, _3.5.x_, _3.6.x_ on _win-32_, _win-64_,
_osx-64_, _linux-64_ and _linux-armv7l_ via anaconda. The module supports communicating with
[various Ocean Optics spectrometers](#supported-devices) via one of two
backends. More information on the backends is available
[here](docs/BACKENDS.md). The recommended default is **cseabreeze**.
Everything required ships with the conda package.



## Installation


### THE RECOMMENDED WAY - Anaconda

python-seabreeze now ships pre-built packages for
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). If you're not using Anaconda
yet, start using it now. As a scientist, who spent way to much time dealing
with stupid computer problems, I urge you to switch all your python development
to Anaconda environments. It'll save you a lot of time, believe me.
(for RaspberryPIs I recommend using [Berryconda](https://github.com/jjhelmus/berryconda))

To install the module run the following in your conda environment. This will
install the module and the dependencies you need for the cseabreeze backend.

```bash
conda install -c poehlmann python-seabreeze
```

**IF WINDOWS:**
you need to install driver-files for your spectrometer from [here](misc/windows-driver-files.zip). These drivers tell windows to use the winusb driver for the spectrometer. It's
possible that OceanView won't find the spectrometer anymore after this. Extract the drivers to a location you like. Goto _Device Manager_. Select your spectrometer, _right click_ and _update driver software_.
Then choose a suiting driver from the extracted folder.

**IF LINUX:**
you need to install the udev rules from [here](misc/10-oceanoptics.rules). These give all users access to connected usb spectrometers and are required, so that you can access the
spectrometers via libusb as a user without root privileges. Download and copy this file to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and run `sudo udevadm --reload-rules`. Replug your spectrometer.

**IF OSX:**
You're all set. It should already work.

If you think that you can't install this module because there is something
wrong with it, read through the installation instructions again. Then try to
look for a solution for your problem [on the internet](https://www.google.com)
at least three times. If nothing helped, read the [contributing
guidelines](#contributing-guidelines), file an issue on github and be nice.
Please note, that I am not an Ocean Optics employee and am maintaining this
module in my free time.


## Usage

The following example shows how simple it is to acquire a spectrum with
python-seabreeze through the model independent _Spectrometer_ class. For a more
detailed description read the (currently incomplete) [documentation](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).:

```python
>>> import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
>>> devices = sb.list_devices()
>>> print devices
[<SeaBreezeDevice USB2000PLUS:USB2+H02749>, <SeaBreezeDevice USB2000PLUS:USB2+H02751>]
>>> spec = sb.Spectrometer(devices[0])
>>> spec.integration_time_micros(12000)
>>> spec.wavelengths()
array([  340.32581   ,   340.70321186,   341.08058305, ...,  1024.84940994,
        1025.1300678 ,  1025.4106617 ])
>>> spec.intensities()
array([  1.58187931e+01,   2.66704852e+04,   6.80208103e+02, ...,
         6.53090172e+02,   6.35011552e+02,   6.71168793e+02])
```

To use the pyseabreeze backend simply run this before importing
seabreeze.spectrometers. The pyseabreeze backend requires [pyUSB](https://walac.github.io/pyusb/) to be
installed. (Look at the [backends documentation](docs/BACKENDS.md) for more
info.)

```python
>>> import seabreeze
>>> seabreeze.use('pyseabreeze')
>>> import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
```
