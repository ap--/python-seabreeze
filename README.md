Python-seabreeze is the easy way to access your Ocean Optics spectrometers from
python. It wraps the [SeaBreeze](http://oceanoptics.com/product/seabreeze/)
library provided by Ocean Optics to communicate with the spectrometer. It also
provides a pyUSB based reimplementation of SeaBreeze for easy extension.
**This software is not associated with Ocean Optics. Use it at your own risk.**

## DOCUMENTATION ON RTD

You'll find the documentation and more detailed information here
[https://python-seabreeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://python-seabreeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Changes

The changelog can be found here [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Install

```bash
# via pypi
pip install seabreeze
seabreeze_os_setup
```

or

```bash
# via conda
conda install -c conda-forge seabreeze
seabreeze_os_setup
```

### Using the backend pyseabreeze in Windows

The backend pyseabreeze requires the libraries pyusb and libusb
```bash
# via pypi
pip install seabreeze[pyseabreeze]  # this ensures installation of pyusb
```
Additionally, you might need to manually install libusb1. Go here https://libusb.info/, Downloads -> Latest Windows Binaries. In the zip file, enter either the folder MinGW64/dll or MinGW32/dll (depending on your OS). Copy the file `libusb-1.0.dll` into `C:\Windows\System32`.


## Usage

The following example shows how simple it is to acquire a spectrum with
python-seabreeze through the model independent _Spectrometer_ class. For a more
detailed description read the [documentation](https://python-seabreeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```python
>>> from seabreeze.spectrometers import Spectrometer
>>> spec = Spectrometer.from_first_available()
>>> spec.integration_time_micros(20000)
>>> spec.wavelengths()
array([  340.32581   ,   340.70321186,   341.08058305, ...,  1024.84940994,
        1025.1300678 ,  1025.4106617 ])
>>> spec.intensities()
array([  1.58187931e+01,   2.66704852e+04,   6.80208103e+02, ...,
         6.53090172e+02,   6.35011552e+02,   6.71168793e+02])
```

To use the pyseabreeze backend (requires `pyusb`) simply run this before importing `seabreeze.spectrometers`.

```python
>>> import seabreeze
>>> seabreeze.use('pyseabreeze')
>>> import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
```

## Reading spectra via ethernet

This functionality is currently implemented for the HDX with the pyseabreeze backend.
The following example shows how to read a spectrum via ethernet:

```pycon
>>> import seabreeze
... from seabreeze.spectrometers import Spectrometer
...
... seabreeze.use("pyseabreeze", network_adapter="192.168.254.200")
>>>
>>> spec = Spectrometer.from_serial_number("HDX12345")
>>> spec.intensities()
array([1967.07287765, 1325.69702018, 1418.40732539, ..., 1398.4680335 ,
       1406.44364585, 1397.47109175])
```
