Python-seabreeze is the easy way to access your Ocean Optics spectrometers from
python. It wraps the [SeaBreeze](http://oceanoptics.com/product/seabreeze/)
library provided by Ocean Optics to communicate with the spectrometer. It also
provides a pyUSB based reimplementation of SeaBreeze for easy extension.
**This software is not associated with Ocean Optics. Use it at your own risk.**

## DOCUMENTATION ON RTD

## Changes

The changelog can be found here [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Install

```bash
# via pypi
pip install seabreeze
seabreeze_os_setup
```

or

```bash
# via conda
conda install -c conda-forge seabreeze
seabreeze_os_setup
```

## Usage

The following example shows how simple it is to acquire a spectrum with
python-seabreeze through the model independent _Spectrometer_ class. For a more
detailed description read the [documentation](https://python-seabreeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```python
>>> from seabreeze.spectrometers import Spectrometer
>>> spec = Spectrometer.from_first_available()
>>> spec.integration_time_micros(20000)
>>> spec.wavelengths()
array([  340.32581   ,   340.70321186,   341.08058305, ...,  1024.84940994,
        1025.1300678 ,  1025.4106617 ])
>>> spec.intensities()
array([  1.58187931e+01,   2.66704852e+04,   6.80208103e+02, ...,
         6.53090172e+02,   6.35011552e+02,   6.71168793e+02])
```

To use the pyseabreeze backend (requires `pyusb`) simply run this before importing `seabreeze.spectrometers`.

```python
>>> import seabreeze
>>> seabreeze.use('pyseabreeze')
>>> import seabreeze.spectrometers as sb
```
